<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device security

#### Improved Intune reporting experience<!-- 3791418   -->
Intune now provides an improved reporting experience, including new report types, better report organization, more focused views, improved report functionality, as well as more consistent and timely data. The reporting experience will move from public preview to GA (general availability). Additionally, the GA release will provide localization support, bug fixes, design improvements, and aggregate device compliance data on tiles in the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431). 

New report types focus on the following:
- **Operational** - Provides fresh records with a negative health focus. 
- **Organizational** - Provides an broader summary of the overall state.
- **Historical** - Provides patterns and trends over a period of time.
- **Specialist** - Allows you to use raw data to create your own custom reports.

The first set of new reports focuses on device compliance. For more information, see [Blog - Microsoft Intune reporting framework](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Intune-Customer-Success/New-Reporting-Framework-Coming-to-Intune/ba-p/1009553) and [Intune reports](~/fundamentals/reports.md).

#### Consolidated the location of security baselines in the UI<!-- 6177074   -->
We've consolidated the paths to find [security baselines](../protect/security-baselines.md) in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center by removing *Security baselines* from several UI locations. To find Security baselines, you now use the following path:  **Endpoint security** > **Security baselines**.

#### Expanded support for imported PKCS certificates<!-- 6044197 WNReady -->
We've expanded support for using [imported PKCS certificates](../protect/certificates-imported-pfx-configure.md#supported-platforms) to support *Android Enterprise fully managed devices*. Generally, importing PFX certificates is used for S/MIME encryption scenarios, where a user's encryption certificates are required on all of their devices so that email decryption can occur.

The following platforms support import of PFX certificates:
- Android - Device Administrator
- Android Enterprise - Fully Managed
- Android Enterprise - Work profile
- iOS
- Mac
- Windows 10

#### View the endpoint security configuration for devices<!-- 6206460  -->
We've updated the name of the option in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center, for viewing [endpoint security configurations that apply to a specific device](../protect/security-baselines-monitor.md#view-endpoint-security-configurations-per-device). This option is renamed to **Endpoint security configuration** because it shows applicable security baselines and additional policies created outside of security baselines. Previously, this option was named *Security baselines*. 

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Role-based access control

#### Intune Roles user interface changes coming<!--5801612   -->
The user interface for [Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) > **Tenant administration** > **Roles** has been improved to a more user-friendly and intuitive design. This experience provides the same settings and details that you use now, however the new experience employs a wizard-like process.

## Week of December 9, 2019 (1912 Service release)

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### App management

#### Migrating to Microsoft Edge for managed browsing scenarios<!-- 5173762 -->
As we move closer to the retirement of the Intune Managed Browser, we made changes to app protection policies to simplify the steps needed to move your users over to Edge. We have updated the options for the app protection policy setting **Restrict web content transfer with other apps** to be one of the following:

- Any app
- Intune Managed Browser
- Microsoft Edge
- Unmanaged browser 

When you select **Microsoft Edge**, your end users will see conditional access messaging notifying them that Microsoft Edge is required for managed browsing scenarios. They will be prompted to download and sign-in to Microsoft Edge with their AAD accounts, if they have not already done so.  This will be the equivalent to having targeted your MAM-enabled apps with the app config setting `com.microsoft.intune.useEdge` set to **True**. Existing app protection policies that used the **Policy managed browsers** setting will now have **Intune Managed Browser** selected, and you will see no change in behavior. This means your users will see messaging to use Microsoft Edge if you've set the **useEdge** app configuration setting to **True**. We encourage all customers leveraging managed browsing scenarios to update their app protection policies with **Restrict web content transfer with other apps** to ensure users are seeing the proper guidance to transition to Microsoft Edge, no matter which app they are launching links from. 

#### Configure app notification content for organization accounts<!-- 2576686  -->
Intune app protection policies (APP) on Android and iOS devices allow you to control app notification content for Org accounts. You can select an option (Allow, Block org Data, or Blocked) to specify how notifications for org accounts are shown for the selected app.This feature requires support from applications and may not be available for all APP enabled applications. Outlook for iOS version 4.15.0 (or later) and Outlook for Android 4.83.0 (or later) will support this setting. The setting is available in the console, but the functionality will begin to take effect after December 16, 2019. For more about APP, see [What are app protection policies?](../apps/app-protection-policy.md).

#### Microsoft app icons update<!--4677605  -->
The icons used for Microsoft apps in the app targeting pane for App protection policies and App configuration policies have been updated.

#### Require use of approved keyboards on Android<!--4761794  -->
As part of an app protection policy, you can specify the setting [**Approved keyboards**](../apps/app-protection-policy-settings-android.md#data-protection) to manage which Android keyboards can be used with managed Android apps. When a user opens the managed app and doesn't already use an approved keyboard for that app, they are prompted to switch to one of the approved keyboards already installed on their device. If needed, they're presented with a link to download an approved keyboard from the Google Play Store, which they can install and set up. The user can only edit text fields in a managed app when their active keyboard isn't one of the approved keyboards.

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device configuration

#### Updated single sign-on experience for apps and websites on your iOS, iPadOS, and macOS devices<!-- 4999578  -->
Intune has added more single sign-on (SSO) settings for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS devices. You can now configure redirect SSO app extensions written by your organization or by your identity provider. Use these settings to configure a seamless single sign-on experience for apps and websites that use modern authentication methods, such as OAuth and SAML2. 

These new settings expand on the previous settings for SSO app extensions and Apple's built-in Kerberos extension (**Devices** > **Device configuration** > **Profiles** > **Create profile** > **iOS/iPadOS** or **macOS** for platform type > **Device features** for profile type). 

To see the full range of SSO app extension settings you can configure, go to [SSO on iOS](../configuration/ios-device-features-settings.md#single-sign-on-app-extension) and [SSO on macOS](../configuration/macos-device-features-settings.md#single-sign-on-app-extension).

Applies to:

- iOS/iPadOS
- macOS

#### We have updated two device restriction settings for iOS and iPadOS devices to correct their behavior<!-- 5701352    -->
For iOS devices, you can create device restriction profiles that **Allow over-the-air PKI updates** and **Blocks USB Restricted mode** (**Devices** > **Device configuration** > **Profiles** > **Create profile** > **iOS/iPadOS** for platform > **Device restrictions** for profile type). Prior to this release, the UI settings and descriptions for the following settings were incorrect, and they have now been corrected. Beginning with this release, the settings behavior is as follows:

**Block over-the-air PKI updates**: **Block** prevents your users from receiving software updates unless the device is connected to a computer. **Not configured** (default): allows a device to receive software updates without being connected to a computer.
- Previously, this setting let you configure it as: **Allow**, which let your users receive software updates without connecting their devices to a computer.
**Allow USB accessories while device is locked**: **Allow** lets USB accessories exchange data with a device that's been locked for over an hour. **Not configured** (default) doesn't update USB Restricted mode on the device, and USB accessories will be blocked from transferring data from the device if locked for over an hour.
- Previously, this setting let you configure it as: **Block** to disable USB Restricted mode on supervised devices.

For more information on the setting you can configure, see [iOS and iPadOS device settings to allow or restrict features using Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-ios.md).

This feature applies to:

- OS/iPadOS

#### Wired network device configuration profiles for macOS devices<!-- 3508686  -->
   > [!NOTE]
   > This feature has been delayed, but will be released soon.

#### Block users from configuring certificate credentials in the managed keystore on Android Enterprise device owner devices<!-- 3311998 -->
On Android Enterprise device owner devices, you can configure a new setting that blocks users from configuring their certificate credentials in the managed keystore (**Device configuration** > **Profiles** > **Create profile** > **Android Enterprise** for platform > **Device Owner Only > Device Restrictions** for profile type > **Users + Accounts**).

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device management

#### Protected wipe action now available<!--51150000 -->
You now have the option to use the Wipe device action to perform a protected wipe of a device. Protected wipes are the same as standard wipes, except that they can't be circumvented by powering off the device. A protected wipe will keep trying to reset the device until successful. In some configurations this action may leave the device unable to reboot. For more information, see [Retire or wipe devices](../remote-actions/devices-wipe.md).

#### Device Ethernet MAC address added to device's Overview page<!--5562275 -->
You can now see a device's Ethernet MAC address on the device details page (**Devices** > **All devices** > choose a device > **Overview**.

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device security

#### Improved experience on a shared device when device based conditional access policies are enabled<!-- 1734096  -->
We improved the experience on a shared device with multiple users who are targeted with device based conditional access policy by checking the latest compliance evaluation for the user when enforcing policy. 
For more information, see  the following overview articles:
- [Azure overview for Conditional Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview)
- [Intune device compliance overview](../protect/device-compliance-get-started.md)

#### Use PKCS certificate profiles to provision devices with certificates<!-- 2317124, 2317130, 2317139, 2340517, 2340528, 2340529  -->
You can now use PKCS certificate profiles to issue certificates to *devices* that run Android for Work, iOS/iPadOS, and Windows, when associated with profiles like those for Wi-Fi and VPN. Previously those three platforms supported only user-based certificates, with device-based support being limited to macOS.

> [!NOTE]
> PKCS certificate profiles are not supported with Wi-Fi profiles. Instead, use SCEP certificate profiles when you use an [EAP type](../configuration/wi-fi-settings-windows.md#enterprise-profile).

To use a device-based certificate, while [creating a PKCS certificate profile](../protect/certficates-pfx-configure.md#create-a-pkcs-certificate-profile) for the supported platforms, select **Settings**. You'll now see the setting for **Certificate type**, which supports the options for Device, or User.

### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### Centralized audit logs<!--5603185, 5697164 -->
A new centralized audit log experience now collects audit logs for all categories into one page. You can filter the logs to get the data you're looking for. To see the audit logs, go to **Tenant administration** > **Audit logs**. 

#### Scope tag information included in audit log activity details<!--5763534 -->
Audit log activity details now include scope tag information (for Intune objects that support scope tags). For more information about audit logs, see [Use audit logs to track and monitor events](monitor-audit-logs.md).

#### New Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager co-management licensing<!--5027281-->
Configuration Manager customers with Software Assurance can get Intune co-management for Windows 10 PCs without having to purchase an additional Intune license for co-management. Customers no longer need to assign individual Intune/EMS licenses to their end users for co-managing Windows 10.
- Devices managed by Configuration Manager and enrolled into co-management have almost the same rights as Intune Standalone MDM managed PCs. However, after resetting they can't be re-provisioned by using Autopilot.
- Windows 10 devices enrolled into Intune by using other means require full Intune licenses.
- Devices on other platforms still require full Intune licenses.

For more information, see [Licensing terms](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Licensing/product-licensing/products).

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### App management

#### UI update when selectively wiping app data<!-- 4102028 -->
The UI to selectively wipe app data in Intune has been updated. UI changes include:
- A simplified experience by using a wizard-style format condensed within one pane.
- An update to the create flow to include assignments.
- A summarized page of all things set when viewing properties, prior to creating a new policy or when editing a property. Also, when editing properties, the summary will only show a list of items from the category of properties being edited.

For more information, see [How to wipe only corporate data from Intune-managed apps](~/apps/apps-selective-wipe.md).

#### iOS and iPadOS third party keyboard support<!-- 4922950 -->
In March  2019, we announced the removal of support for the iOS App protection policy setting "Third party keyboards". The feature is returning to Intune with both iOS and iPadOS support. To enable this setting, visit the **Data protection** tab of a new or existing iOS/iPadOS app protection policy and find the **Third party keyboards** setting under **Data Transfer**.

The behavior of this policy setting differs slightly from the previous implementation. In multi-identity apps using SDK version 12.0.16 and later, targeted by app protection policies with this setting configured to **Block**, end-users will be unable to opt for third party keyboards in both their organization and personal accounts. Apps using SDK versions 12.0.12 and earlier will continue to exhibit the behavior documented in our blog post title, [Known issue: Third party keyboards are not blocked in iOS for personal accounts](https://aka.ms/3rdparty_iOS_Intune).

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device configuration

#### Target macOS user groups to require Jamf management<!-- 4061739  --> 
You can target specific groups of users that will get their [macOS devices managed by Jamf](../protect/conditional-access-integrate-jamf.md). This enables you apply the Jamf compliance integration to a subset of macOS devices while other devices are managed by Intune. If you are already using the Jamf integration, All Users will be targeted for the integration by default.

#### New Exchange ActiveSync settings when creating an Email device configuration profile on iOS devices<!-- 4892824   --> 
On iOS/iPadOS devices, you can configure email connectivity in a device configuration profile (**Device configuration** > **Profiles** > **Create profile** > **iOS/iPadOS** for platform > **Email** for profile type). 

There are new Exchange ActiveSync settings available, including:
- **Exchange data to sync**: Choose the Exchange services to sync (or block syncing) for Calendar, Contacts, Reminders, Notes, and Email.
- **Allow users to change sync settings**: Allow (or block) users to change the sync settings for these services on their devices.  

For more information on these setting, go to [Email profile settings for iOS devices in Intune](../configuration/email-settings-ios.md).

#### Prevent users from adding personal Google accounts to Android Enterprise fully managed and dedicated devices<!-- 5353228   -->
On Android Enterprise fully managed and dedicated devices, there's a new setting that prevent users from creating personal Google accounts (**Device configuration** > **Profiles** > **Create profile** > **Android Enterprise** for platform > **Device Owner Only > Device Restrictions** for profile type > **Users and Accounts settings** > **Personal Google Accounts**).

To see the settings you can configure, go to [Android Enterprise device settings to allow or restrict features using Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-android-for-work.md).

Applies to:

- Android Enterprise fully managed devices
- Android Enterprise dedicated devices

#### Server-side logging for Siri commands setting is removed in iOS/iPadOS device restrictions profile <!-- 5468501   -->
On iOS and iPadOS devices, the **Server-side logging for Siri commands** setting is removed from the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin console (**Device configuration** > **Profiles** > **Create profile** > **iOS/iPadOS** for platform > **Device restrictions** for profile type > **Built-in apps**). 

This setting has no effect on devices. To remove the setting from existing profiles, open the profile, make any change, and then save the profile. The profile is updated, and the setting is deleted from devices.

To see all the settings you can configure, see [iOS and iPadOS device settings to allow or restrict features using Intune](../configuration/device-restrictions-ios.md).

Applies to:

- iOS/iPadOS

#### Windows 10 feature updates (public preview)<!-- 2384877 -->
You can now deploy [Windows 10 feature updates](../protect/windows-update-for-business-configure.md#windows-10-feature-updates) to Windows 10 devices. Windows 10 feature updates are a new software update policy that sets the version of Windows 10 that you want devices to install and remain at. You can use this new policy type along with your existing Windows 10 update rings.

Devices that receive Windows 10 feature updates policy will install the specified version of Windows, and then remain at that version until the policy is edited or removed. Devices that run a later version of Windows remain at their current version. Devices that are held at a specific version of Windows can still install quality and security updates for that version from Windows 10 update rings.

This new type of policy begins rolling out to tenants this week. If this policy isn't available for your tenant yet, it will be soon.

#### Add and change key information in plist files for macOS applications<!-- 4736278 -->
On macOS devices, you can now create a device configuration profile that uploads a property list file (.plist) associated with an app or with the device (**Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile** > **macOS** for platform > **Preference File** for profile type).

Only some apps support managed preferences, and these apps might not allow you to manage all settings. Be sure to upload a property list file that configures device channel settings, not user channel settings.

For more information on this feature, see [Add a property list file to macOS devices using Microsoft Intune](../configuration/preference-file-settings-macos.md).

Applies to:

- macOS devices running 10.7 and newer

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Device management

### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### Updated support experience<!-- 5012398 -->

Starting today, an updated and streamlined in-console experience for [getting help and support for Intune](get-support.md) is rolling out to tenants. If this new experience isn't available for you yet, it will be soon.

We've improved the in-console search and feedback for common issues, and the workflow you use to contact support. When opening a support issue, you'll see real-time estimates for when you can expect a callback or email reply, and Premier and Unified support customers can easily specify a severity for their issue, to help get support faster.

#### Improved Intune reporting experience (public preview) <!-- 3791418 -->
Intune now provides an improved reporting experience, including new report types, better report organization, more focused views, improved report functionality, as well as more consistent and timely data. New report types focus on the following:
- **Operational** - Provides fresh records with a negative health focus. 
- **Organizational** - Provides an broader summary of the overall state.
- **Historical** - Provides patterns and trends over a period of time.
- **Specialist** - Allows you to use raw data to create your own custom reports.

The first set of new reports focuses on device compliance. For more information, see [Blog - Microsoft Intune reporting framework](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Intune-Customer-Success/New-Reporting-Framework-Coming-to-Intune/ba-p/1009553) and [Intune reports](~/fundamentals/reports.md).

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Role-based access control

#### Duplicate custom or built-in roles <!-- 1081938   -->
You can now copy built-in and custom roles. For more information, see [Copy a role](../fundamentals/create-custom-role.md#copy-a-role).

#### New permissions for school administrator role <!-- 5621805  -->  
Two new permissions, **Assign profile** and **Sync device**, have been added to the school administrator role > **Permissions** > **Enrollment programs**. The sync profile permission lets group admins sync Windows Autopilot devices. The assign profile permission lets them delete user-initiated Apple enrollment profiles. It also gives them permission to manage Autopilot device assignments and Autopilot deployment profile assignments. For a list of all school administrator/group admin permissions, see [Assign group admins](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune-education/group-admin-delegate). 

<!-- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv -->
### Security

#### BitLocker key rotation<!-- 2564951  -->
You can use an Intune device action to remotely [rotate BitLocker recovery keys](../protect/encrypt-devices.md#rotate-bitlocker-recovery-keys)  for managed devices that run Windows version 1909 or later. To qualify to have recovery keys rotated, devices must be configured to support recovery key rotation.  

#### Updates to dedicated device enrollment to support SCEP device certificate deployment <!-- 5198878  -->
Intune now supports SCEP device certificate deployment to Android Enterprise dedicated devices for certificate-based access to Wi-Fi profiles. The Microsoft Intune app must be present on the device for deployment to work. As a result, we've updated the enrollment experience for Android Enterprise dedicated devices. New enrollments still start the same (with QR, NFC, Zero-touch, or device identifier) but now have a step that requires users to install the Intune app. Existing devices will start getting the app automatically installed on a rolling basis.

#### Intune audit logs for business-to-business collaboration<!--5670211 -->
Business-to-business (B2B) collaboration allows you to securely share you company's applications and services with guest users from any other organization, while maintaining control over your own corporate data. Intune now supports audit logs for B2B guest users. For example, when guest users make changes, Intune will be able to capture this data through audit logs. For more information, see [What is guest user access in Azure Active Directory B2B?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/b2b/what-is-b2b)

#### Improved macOS enrollment experience in Company Portal <!-- 5074349  -->  
The Company Portal for macOS enrollment experience has a simpler enrollment process that aligns more closely with the Company Portal for iOS enrollment experience. Device users now see:  

* A sleeker user interface.  
* An improved enrollment checklist.  
* Clearer instructions about how to enroll their devices.  
* Improved troubleshooting options.  

#### Web apps launched from the Windows Company Portal app<!-- 5030972 -->
End-users can now launch web apps directly from the Windows Company Portal app. End-users can select the web app and then choose the option **Open in browser**. The published web URL is opened directly in a web browser. This functionality will be rolled out over the next week. For more information about Web apps, see [Add web apps to Microsoft Intune](~/apps/web-app.md).  

#### New assignment type column in Company Portal for Windows 10 <!-- 5459950  -->
The Company Portal > **Installed Apps** > **Assignment type** column has been renamed to **Required by your organization**.  Under that column, users will see a **Yes** or **No** value to indicate that an app is either required or made optional by their organization. These changes were made because device users were confused about the concept of available apps. Your users can find more information about installing apps from Company Portal in [Install and share apps on your device](/intune-user-help/install-apps-cpapp-windows). For more  information about configuring the Company Portal app for your users, see [How to configure the Microsoft Intune Company Portal app](~/apps/company-portal-app.md).
